The TRAVIS test running is the file test_script.py
test_script.py runs python_interpreter.py with the input file ex1.py

test_script.py
-Runs tests
-Compares answers
-Exits with error if printed answers are wrong

ex1.py
-Statements to test python_interpreter.py

python_interpreter.py
-Uses ply (Python Lex and Yacc) library
-tokens, definitions are defined for lex()
-grammar rules and actions are defined for yacc()
-Input is picked line by line from ex1.py, evaluated and action performed( Eventually "print answer" )

To run Test usage
-python test_script.py
-If error, exits with error message
-If not exits normally

To run Interpreter
-python python_interpreter.py <input_file>
-Input file should contain basic python statements ( arithmetic operations and prints only)
